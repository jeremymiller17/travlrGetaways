CS-465 Fullstack Development with MEAN


Branches: Module 1-7 catalog the development of this project

## Architecture

This project was created to introduce us to the MEAN stack which is MongoDB,Express, Angular and Node. The various branches are the projects creation through the span of a class. Starting with a staic html template, and incrementally updating new features such as an MVC structure, dynamic HTML using Handlebars, the creation of a REST api, a SPA front end admin page with angular, and a MongoDb database to store the trip information.
    
    

## Functionality

This is not a finished product, the final evaluation of this capstone project was to ensure that the API connections are established and working properly. Though the majority of the website is unusable the SPA is able to add,edit, and delete trip destinations, and the destinations are visible on the main trips page.
